        <h3> JavaScript Objects </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
          You may have heard the term object before.
          
          Objects are similar to arrays, except that
           instead of using indexes to access and modify 
           their data, you access the data in objects 
           through what are called properties. </p>
          
           <p>
          Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way,
           and can represent real world objects, like a cat.
          
          Here's a sample cat object:
              <br>
          const cat = { <br>
            "name": "Whiskers", <br>
            "legs": 4, <br>
            "tails": 1, <br>
            "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"] <br>
          }; <br>
          </p>
          </div>
      
          <br>
          <div>
      
        <p>
          In this example, all the properties are stored as strings,
           such as name, legs, and tails. However, you can also
            use numbers as properties. You can even omit the 
            quotes for single-word string properties, as </p>
          <br>
          const anotherObject = { <br>
            make: "Ford", <br>
            5: "five", <br>
            "model": "focus" <br>
          }; <br>
          <p>
          However, if your object has any non-string properties, 
          JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.
      </p>
      </div>

         <h3> Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation </h3>
      
         <div>
         <p>
      There are two ways to access the properties of an 
      object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), 
      similar to an array.
      
      Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of 
      the property you're trying to access ahead of time.
      
      Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an 
      object's property: </p>
      
      <br>
      const myObj = { <br>
        prop1: "val1", <br>
        prop2: "val2" <br>
      }; <br>
      <br>
      const prop1val = myObj.prop1; <br>
      const prop2val = myObj.prop2; <br>
      <p>prop1val would have a value of the string val1, 
          and prop2val would have a value of the string val2.</p> 
      </div>

       <h3> Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation </h3>
   
       <p> The second way to access the properties of an object
         is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object
          you are trying to access has a space in its name, 
          you will need to use bracket notation.
        <br>
        However, you can still use bracket notation on object 
        properties without spaces.

        Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an 
        object's property: </p>
        
        <br>
const myObj = { <br>
  "Space Name": "Kirk", <br>
  "More Space": "Spock", <br>
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise" <br>
}; <br>
 <br>
 <p>assessing with [] notation</p>

const "SpaceValue" = myObj["Space Name"]; <br>
const "MoreValue" = myObj['More Space']; <br>
const "NoSpaceValue" = myObj["NoSpace"]; <br>

myObj["Space Name"] would be the string Kirk, <br>
myObj['More Space'] would be the string Spock, <br>
myObj["NoSpace"] would be the string USS Enterprise. <br>

<p> Note that property names with spaces in them must
     be in quotes (single or double). </p>

     <h3> Updating Object Properties</h3>
     <p>
After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

For example, let's look at ourDog: You can dot notation or
bracket notation to update an object.

</p>
const ourDog = { <br>
  "name": "Camper", <br>
  "legs": 4, <br>
  "tails": 1, <br>
  "friends": ["everything!"] <br>
}; <br>
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his 
name to the string Happy Camper. 

Here's how we update his object's name property:
<br> 
ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; <br>
or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; <br>

<p> Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting Camper,
     we'll get his new name, Happy Camper. </p>
